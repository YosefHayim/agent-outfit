# LANGUAGE.md — agent-outfit

The human↔agent glossary: names only. Use these exact terms in code, comments,
commits, and docs; avoid the listed aliases. Orientation lives in `CONTEXT.md`.

Names are plain English, one word per idea. A file is named after what is inside it,
and a command file is named after its command.

## Terms

**owned file**
A file the installer manages, recorded in the receipt's `ownedFiles` list or marked by the `/agent-outfit/` path.
_Avoid_: "managed" (without receipt context), "artifact".

**feature**
An installable unit such as `context-guard`, `duplicate-code-guard`, `autorun`, or `image-to-code` (public kebab-case IDs).
_Avoid_: "plugin", "extension".

**sourceDirectory**
Authored camelCase directory naming a feature under `src/skills/` (payload) or `src/hooks/` (hook code) — e.g. `contextGuard`, `duplicateCodeGuard`, `imageToCode`. Distinct from the public feature ID.
_Avoid_: "skill folder name" when used as public ID.

**skill**
Agent instruction set under `src/skills/<sourceDirectory>/`. Installed directory names stay kebab-case data.
_Avoid_: "prompt", "instruction file".

**skill payload**
Approved compound for authored content under `src/skills/` copied verbatim into an installed skill directory, including its `scripts/` and `templates/`.
_Avoid_: standalone "payload", "skill code".

**hook code**
Executable dependency-free code under `src/hooks/<sourceDirectory>/` plus the shared `src/hooks/lib/`. Compiled and installed to `.claude/agent-outfit/hooks/`. A feature's folders: `hooks/` holds registered agent hooks, `watchers/` the background processes a hook starts, `command/` scripts the CLI or a skill runs, and `lib/` its own code.
_Avoid_: "skills", "payload".

**hook**
Zero-dependency script that runs on an agent hook event. Must be **fail-open**.
_Avoid_: "callback", "handler" (imprecise).

**hook library**
Dependency-free code every hook feature shares under `src/hooks/lib/` (`hookConfig`, `hookOutput`, `processAlive`, `transcriptReader`), copied into each hook feature's `lib/` at install.
_Avoid_: "payload", "bundle", "binary".

**watcher**
Background Node process a hook starts so it can act later: the autorun watcher, the idle compact watcher, and the rehome watcher. It lives in its feature's `watchers/` folder.
_Avoid_: "service", "background job", "worker".

**decision**
Pure function that says what should happen next (`decideAutorunStep`, `decideIdleCompactAction`, `decideDuplicateEdit`, `decideScratchWrite`, `decideRehome`), kept apart from the code that acts on it. Its module is named `<area>Decision.ts`.
_Avoid_: "policy engine", "rule engine".

**catalog**
The allowlist in `src/catalog/featureCatalog.ts` that declares every feature and what it ships.
_Avoid_: "registry", "manifest", "`FEATURES`" alone.

**receipt**
Ownership record at `.claude/agent-outfit/receipt.json` authorizing install/update/uninstall changes.
_Avoid_: "manifest".

**ships / shippedPaths**
Per-feature allowlist of paths copied into a user's install. Fail-safe: unlisted paths ship nothing.
_Avoid_: "includes", "files".

**scope**
Where one installation lives: `global` (the home root, `~/.claude`) or `project` (a project root, `./.claude`). Each scope has its own receipt and config.json.
_Avoid_: "target" for the scope itself, "level".

**host**
The machine an install changes, as opposed to the package: its home and project roots, its agents, and their files. `hostScan` reads it; `hostFiles` snapshots its files.
_Avoid_: "system", "environment" (that word is for environment variables).

**prepared package**
The catalog-closed copy of hook code and skill payload under `dist/prepared/` that install, update, and doctor read.
_Avoid_: "bundle", "build output".

**restoration**
A planned change that puts back a receipted file's bytes from before install: a rewrite, a removal, or a restored value inside a shared file.
_Avoid_: "rollback", "revert".

**doctor / health**
`doctor` is the read-only command; the **health** report is what it returns for one scope (installation, config, features, agents, watchers, discrepancies).
_Avoid_: "diagnostics", "status check".

**surgical install / uninstall**
Receipt-authorized edits that restore prior bytes on uninstall.
_Avoid_: "merge", "patch".

**setting**
One `config.json` key defined in `src/config/configSchema.ts`. The key starts with its area word (`contextWarnPercent`); the CLI name is its kebab-case form (`context-warn-percent`).
_Avoid_: "option", "flag" (those are CLI arguments).

**environment variable**
A `AGENT_OUTFIT_<AREA>_<SETTING>` name listed in `src/config/environmentVariables.ts`, for example `AGENT_OUTFIT_IDLE_COMPACT_AFTER`.
_Avoid_: "env key".

**context-guard**
Nudge `/handoff` at the warn percent and hard-deny new code edits at the block percent.
_Avoid_: "context manager".

**idle compact**
Optional native-hook loop that submits one idle draft, waits for any resulting turn, compacts once, then parks.
_Avoid_: "autorun" (different context-budget loop), "timer wrapper".

**native hook adapter**
Catalog evidence that an agent's lifecycle events, config path, and compact command were verified.
_Avoid_: "supported" without evidence.

**terminal claim**
Session-start proof binding automation to one stable Ghostty terminal ID, including tabs and splits.
_Avoid_: "focused pane", "front window".

**duplicate-code-guard**
Guard that blocks a copied function body or type shape at write time. `agent-outfit duplicates` runs the same check from the CLI or CI.
_Avoid_: "duplicate checker".

**scratch-folder-guard**
Guard that denies agent writes into system temporary folders and deletes an ended Claude Code session's own scratch folder. Code names say "scratch" because `temp`/`tmp` are forbidden name tokens.
_Avoid_: "temp guard", "tmp hook".

**session-rehome**
Feature that moves an ended Claude Code session or Codex thread into the local repo its work was about, so that repo's `/resume` or `codex resume` lists it. "Rehome" is the verb for that move; a session's **home** is the folder its agent lists it under.
_Avoid_: "migrate", "relocate" (Claude Code's own word for its worktree moves).

**sweep**
session-rehome's pass over every ended session that is not yet settled in the ledger. The SessionStart hook starts one at most every ten minutes; `rehomeWatcher --sweep` runs one by hand.
_Avoid_: "scan", "crawl".

**ledger**
session-rehome's append-only record of every decision (moved, stayed, uncertain, no-signal, deleted, conflict); the newest line for a session wins.
_Avoid_: "log", "history" (Claude Code's `history.jsonl` is a different file).

**autorun**
Feature and skill that arms the context-guard autorun watcher for hands-free compact/resume (`stop`/`exit` verbs). Its hook code is owned by **context-guard**.
_Avoid_: "auto-compact", "autopilot".

**image-to-code**
Image (PNG, screenshot, design) → measured pixel-perfect code skill (SVG/HTML/CSS) with screenshot-diff harness.

**workflow scaffold**
CLI command that copies the owned single-gate CI/publish set into another repository.
_Avoid_: "ci-setup".

**fail-open**
Hooks must exit successfully on any error so a guard bug never blocks the user.
_Avoid_: "graceful degrade".

**capability layout**
Folders group by product capability (`cli`, `catalog`, `config`, `install`, `hooks`, `skills`, `doctor`, `workflows`), plus the outer-ring `scripts`, the copied `templates`, and the `statuslines` presets.
_Avoid_: "src/core layers", pure-core/imperative-shell folders.

**biome**
Linter and formatter; `biome ci` is the lint half of the gate.
_Avoid_: "linter", "prettier" (only half).

**co-located tests**
`foo.test.ts` beside `foo.ts`; a test of one aspect of a module is `foo.<aspect>.test.ts` (`featureCatalog.skillPayload.test.ts`).
_Avoid_: "test/ dir".

**vertical per feature**
Each feature owns one folder named for its `sourceDirectory` — under `src/skills/` when it ships payload, under `src/hooks/` when it ships hook code.
_Avoid_: "horizontal layers".

**single command per tool surface**
One `autorun` skill with verbs instead of multiple thin skills.
_Avoid_: "one skill per verb".

**agent root contract**
Root `AGENTS.md`, authoritative for agent behavior and the routing map to delegated subject SSOTs.
_Avoid_: "agent digest" when implying it is non-authoritative.

**SSOT**
Single source of truth; the full managed-configuration contract lives in `src/config/configSchema.ts`, every environment variable in `src/config/environmentVariables.ts`, while `src/hooks/lib/hookConfig.ts` holds only the dependency-free hook projection.
_Avoid_: "source of truth" (acceptable, but the acronym is established).

**voxkey / free-model-router**
Separate apps that own voice and free provider routing. agent-outfit does not ship, call, or configure them.
_Avoid_: describing their internals here.

**clean break**
No back-compat shims on renames/pivots. Old installs upgrade by uninstalling with the old version, then installing the new one.
_Avoid_: "migration", "deprecation".

**verify**
The one aggregate script that owns every repository check required by CI.
_Avoid_: "qa", "validate".
