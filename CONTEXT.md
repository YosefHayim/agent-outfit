# CONTEXT.md — dufflebag

Orientation: what this is, its moving parts, and how they fit. For the words, see
`LANGUAGE.md`; for purpose and direction, `PROJECT.md`; for how code is written,
`CODE-STYLE.md`; for how to work in the repo, `AGENTS.md`.

## What this is

`dufflebag` is a personal toolbelt, not a platform: a TypeScript/Node CLI that installs, updates, and surgically uninstalls a curated set of coding-agent guardrails, skills, and copyable CI/publish workflow templates. Installed TypeScript hooks are separate dependency-free Node code. Voice (dictation, read-aloud, prompt refinement) is a separate app, voxkey.

## Actors

- **The owner / user** — runs `npx ys-dufflebag install` to wire guardrails into `~/.claude` (global) or `./.claude` (project).
- **Claude Code, Codex, and Grok** — verified native lifecycle-hook targets.
- **Other agents** — detected and wired only through verified catalog-driven formats; unsupported hook adapters are reported, not guessed.
- **CI / `workflow scaffold` consumers** — repositories that copy the single-gate CI/publish set from `src/templates/workflows/`.

## Shape (capability layout)

Application code is grouped by capability, not by technical layer:

- `src/cli/` — Effect CLI edge (`main`, one file per command, `TerminalUI`)
- `src/catalog/` — feature and agent catalogs (decoded data is the SSOT)
- `src/config/` — managed configuration schema, config file read and save, and the list of every environment variable
- `src/install/` — install plans, package preparation, receipts, transactional apply, lifecycle
- `src/hooks/lib/` — dependency-free code shared by every hook feature (`hookConfig` + `hookOutput`)
- `src/skills/<sourceDirectory>/` — authored skill payload only (camelCase directories), shipped verbatim
- `src/hooks/<sourceDirectory>/` — feature-local executable hook code (`hooks/`, `lib/`, `command/`)
- `src/doctor/` — installation health checks behind `dufflebag doctor`
- `src/workflows/` — workflow template copying behind `dufflebag workflow scaffold`
- `src/scripts/` — outer-ring maintainer tooling (build, README generation, style contract); never imported by product code
- `src/templates/` — copyable workflows and project docs
- `src/statuslines/` — agent status-line presets with their own install script
- `dist/prepared/` — catalog-closed prepared package for install/update/doctor

The repository root holds only configuration and top-level docs; everything authored lives under `src/`.

A feature is either payload or hook code, never both: `src/skills/` holds only what is copied verbatim into an installed skill directory, and `src/hooks/` holds only code this repository compiles and installs elsewhere. The split is what lets the style contract apply one rule set per kind of code.

## Key constraints

- Hooks must be **fail-open** — any internal error allows the tool through.
- Ownership is receipt-based: install/update/uninstall change only files the receipt owns.
- Managed config lives at `.claude/dufflebag/config.json` and is schema-owned. Installed hooks read that same file.
- Hook state lives under `.claude/dufflebag/state/` (`autorun/`, `context-guard/`, `context-guard-off`, `idle-compact/`).
- Hook background processes are **watchers** (the autorun watcher, the idle compact watcher).
- Idle compact is off by default, requires macOS + Ghostty 1.3+, and targets a stable terminal ID claimed by the session itself.
- A `DUFFLEBAG_IDLE_COMPACT_AFTER` value set when starting an agent wins over the persistent `idleCompactAfter` config for that session.
- Every setting and environment variable is listed in the Settings section of `README.md`, generated from `src/config/configSchema.ts` and `src/config/environmentVariables.ts`. Environment variables are named `DUFFLEBAG_<AREA>_<SETTING>`, config keys start with their area word (`context`, `autorun`, `idleCompact`, `duplicateCode`, `sessionRehome`, `debug`), and a test fails when a `DUFFLEBAG_*` name in `src/` is missing from the list.
- Authored skill directories use **camelCase**; public feature IDs and installed skill IDs remain **kebab-case** data.
- One strict style bar across maintained TypeScript, documented in root `CODE-STYLE.md`. Biome and `src/scripts/checkCodeStyle.ts` both gate through `pnpm verify`, including `src/hooks/`; portable skill scripts additionally answer to their shipped harnesses.
- Root `AGENTS.md` is the authoritative contract for coding agents and routes each subject to its delegated SSOT.
