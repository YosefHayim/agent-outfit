# Improve skill

Improve an **existing** skill using concrete feedback. The skill file is the product under test; feedback is the bug report / UX note / eval miss.

## Safety

- Identify the **canonical source** skill (repo `src/skills/<dir>/` or the user’s source of truth). Do not “fix” only a generated install copy under `~/.claude/skills` / `~/.codex/skills` / `~/.grok/skills` without updating the source and re-syncing.
- Preserve the skill’s public `name` (kebab-case id) unless the user explicitly renames and updates the catalog/install surface.
- Keep frontmatter valid: `description` ≤ 1024 chars; flow skills start with `Use when `; body has Safety / Workflow / Verification when `type: flow`.
- Do not invent user requirements. If feedback is vague, ask one focused clarifying question or propose 2–3 concrete patches and wait for pick.
- Do not delete safety gates, remote-delete bans, or main-branch protections to “make it easier.”
- After edits, run the repo’s skill validation (`src/catalog/featureCatalog.skillPayload.test.ts` / catalog checks) when this is the agent-outfit monorepo.

## Workflow

1. **Capture feedback** in one place: user quote, failing session behavior, missing trigger phrase, wrong handoff, over-trigger, or eval miss. Note agent host (Codex / Grok / Claude) if relevant.
2. **Locate the skill**: open `SKILL.md` (+ references/scripts). Summarize what it claims today (triggers, steps, done criteria).
3. **Diagnose class of gap** (pick one primary):
   - **Discovery** — description/triggers do not match freeform speech
   - **Routing** — wrong skill chosen vs sibling (finish vs deploy vs preview)
   - **Procedure** — missing/extra steps, wrong order, no mode split
   - **Safety** — too loose or too strict for real use
   - **Verification** — “done” claims without evidence the user needs
   - **Packaging** — missing shipped paths, scripts, catalog deps, sync
4. **Diff plan** (show before edit): exact sections to change, sample new description bullets, any new anti-triggers, what stays untouched.
5. **Patch minimally**: prefer description + one workflow bullet + verification line over a rewrite. For freeform-trigger gaps, add the user’s real phrases. For failure modes, add an explicit anti-path or stop condition.
6. **Cross-links**: if the skill should hand off (e.g. to `finish-and-push`, `run-tasks-in-parallel`), name the sibling skill; if feedback was “I had to paste the whole SKILL.md”, add short aliases / `$name` variants.
7. **Validate**: frontmatter/tests/catalog; optionally dry-run the new description against 3–5 real user phrases (“would this load?”).
8. **Ship path**: if agent-outfit, ensure `featureCatalog` / `shippedPaths` still correct; remind `install-skills` or install so hosts pick up the change. Prefer a feature branch + PR when the repo uses that policy.

## Feedback → edit map

| Feedback shape | Typical edit |
|----------------|--------------|
| “I said X and it never fired” | Expand `description` with X; keep `Use when ` prefix |
| “It did Y when I wanted Z” | Anti-trigger + routing line to sibling skill |
| “It skipped verify / deleted remote” | Harden Safety + Verification |
| “Too long / too many questions” | Short-path workflow mode; defer optional steps |
| “Worked once, broke next agent” | Host-agnostic wording; dual-agent discovery note |
| Eval shows worse tokens/success | Pair with `benchmark-agents`; only keep changes that win same-task compare |

## Verification

Report:

- skill id + source path edited;
- feedback summary (1–3 lines);
- diagnosis class;
- before → after description or key bullets (redacted if needed);
- tests/catalog commands and outcomes;
- how to reinstall/sync for each agent host;
- residual risks (over-trigger, still needs eval).

Do not claim the skill is “fixed” without either a phrase dry-run against the feedback or a same-task re-run the user accepts.
