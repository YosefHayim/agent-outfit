# LANGUAGE.md Format

`LANGUAGE.md` is the **human↔agent glossary** — names only. It pins the exact
words used in code, comments, commits, docs, and agent chat, plus the aliases to
avoid. Orientation lives in `CONTEXT.md`; purpose/direction in `PROJECT.md`;
coding rules in `CODE-STYLE.md`.

This is the stack adaptation of Matt Pocock's domain-language term anatomy
(canonical term → tight definition → `_Avoid_` aliases). In upstream Matt
Pocock skills that anatomy lives inside `CONTEXT.md` under `## Language`. In
**this** stack the glossary is **split out** into `LANGUAGE.md` so `CONTEXT.md`
stays orientation-only.

**Canonical exemplar:** `ai-browser-bridge/LANGUAGE.md`.

## Structure

```md
# LANGUAGE.md — {Project}

The human↔agent glossary: names only. Use these exact terms in code, comments,
commits, and docs; avoid the listed aliases. Orientation lives in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Terms

**Order**
A customer's request to purchase one or more items.
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction.

**Invoice**
A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery.
_Avoid_: Bill, payment request.

**Customer**
A person or organization that places orders.
_Avoid_: Client, buyer, account.
```

### Optional area groups

When natural clusters exist, keep the same term block shape and introduce
sibling `##` section headings (not tables, not bullet lists):

```md
# LANGUAGE.md — {Project}

The human↔agent glossary: names only. Use these exact terms in code, comments,
commits, and docs; avoid the listed aliases. Orientation lives in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Catalog authoring

**Authoring Sheet**
The single spreadsheet that is the content source of truth.
_Avoid_: catalog file, Google sheet (alone).

## Practice

**Session Recipe**
Mood + duration keyed config the Motion Engine loads for a Practice Session.
_Avoid_: workout plan, template (for this concept).
```

A flat `## Terms` section is preferred when everything is one cohesive area.

## Term block anatomy (required)

Every term is three lines of shape (definition may wrap):

1. **`**Term**` on its own line** — Title Case or the exact code-facing spelling.
2. **Definition** — what it **is**, not a how-to. Prefer one or two tight sentences.
3. **`_Avoid_:`** — optional but preferred whenever synonyms exist. Comma-separated
   aliases and short “do not treat X as Y” notes.

```md
**Bridge**
The running tool that connects one terminal session to one — or several at once —
provider Conversations.
_Avoid_: browser instance, bot.
```

## Forbidden shapes

Do **not** emit any of these (historical drift; convert on sight):

| Forbidden | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Markdown tables (`\| Term \| Definition \| Avoid \|`) | Harder for agents to extend; inconsistent column names |
| Bullet glossaries (`- **Term** — def`) | Collapses term / definition / avoid into one line |
| Colon-on-bold (`**Term**:`) | Matt Pocock's *in-CONTEXT* colon form; we use bold-on-own-line |
| `_Avoid:_` (colon inside italics) | Use `_Avoid_:` (underscore-close, then colon) |
| Inline “Use: / Avoid:” dual lines | Fold Use into the definition; aliases go under `_Avoid_:` |
| Putting the glossary in `CONTEXT.md` | In this stack `CONTEXT.md` is orientation, not names |

## Rules

- **Names only.** No implementation walkthroughs, no roadmap, no long decision rationale.
- **Be opinionated.** Pick one canonical term; list rivals under `_Avoid_:`.
- **Project-specific only.** General programming words (timeout, retry, middleware)
  do not belong unless this project redefines them.
- **Group when natural.** Flat `## Terms` otherwise.
- **Create lazily.** Only write `LANGUAGE.md` when the first real domain term is
  resolved. Seed from code and existing docs; do not invent filler terms.
- **Keep `CONTEXT.md` free of glossary blocks.** If a term crystallises during
  grilling, append it here — never as a `## Language` section inside `CONTEXT.md`.

## Who writes this file

| Skill | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `code-style` | Ensure the file exists; create from this format when missing; report structure drift (do not invent terms without evidence) |
| `question-my-plan` / domain-modeling moments | **Owner of term content** — when a term is resolved, update `LANGUAGE.md` inline using this format |
| `explain-my-stack` | Leave alone unless a genuine *domain* term surfaces (tech teaching stays in chat) |

## Single vs multi-context repos

Most repos: one root `LANGUAGE.md`.

Multi-context repos (see `CONTEXT-MAP.md` / multiple `CONTEXT.md` files): still
prefer **one root `LANGUAGE.md`** with `##` sections per bounded context, and a
short note at the top that some words mean different things per context. Only
split into per-context language files if the vocabularies are large and
non-overlapping — then link them from the root file.
