# Sub-agent code scan

Goal: surface the **most-repeated** patterns in an existing codebase as evidence for the style grill. You want dominant reality, not a file dump — so use read-only explore agents that report conclusions, not contents.

## Mechanical pre-scan (run first)

From this skill directory:

```bash
SCAN_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
node scripts/inventory-repository.mjs --root <repo> --out "$SCAN_DIR/style-inventory.json"
node scripts/scan-style-compliance.mjs --root <repo> --out "$SCAN_DIR/style-findings.json"
```

Feed counts and top offenders into the AI-slop and ceremony angles below so sub-agents start with measured prevalence, not a cold tree walk. Finding IDs: [references/finding-taxonomy.md](references/finding-taxonomy.md).

## Fan-out

Spawn a small set of read-only sub-agents in parallel (prefer the `Explore` agent type), each on a different angle. Scale to repo size — 2-3 for a small repo, 5-6 for a large one:

- **Structure** — folder/module layout; where features live; feature- vs layer-based. Also capture the **directory tree** (gitignore-aware, depth-capped) and the **import edges** among top-level modules, so the plan's §⑤ can render a before/after structure map.
- **How a {unit} gets added** — reconstruct the **de-facto extension path** that feeds the Step 6 golden path. From git history, find the **last 1–3 units** added (the project's real unit — feature / endpoint / screen / component / module) and report, for each, the **ordered seams it touched**: files/folders created, the barrel or **registration/manifest** point edited, route table, DI container, migration, test file, docs. Bring back the **common sequence** and whether it's **consistent or ad-hoc** (no repeatable path is itself a finding — the golden path becomes the road that didn't exist yet).
- **Boundaries & contracts** — what's shared vs local; where types/contracts live; import direction.
- **Data vs side effects** — pure core vs I/O; where side effects happen.
- **Errors & validation** — throw vs return; error types; boundary validation.
- **Naming** — conventions for files, functions, variables; what names encode.
- **Tests** — presence, location, style, what's actually covered.
- **AI-slop fingerprint** — hunt the recognizable AI tells, since slop is high-frequency and easily mistaken for a convention: giveaway micro-helpers (`isRecord`, `isObject`, `isNonEmptyString`, `isDefined`, `ensureArray`, `noop`, `assertNever`), defensive over-guards (redundant null/type checks the types already prove), nested or duplicated ternaries, one-use wrapper functions, copy-pasted boilerplate (identical `try/catch` or `if (!x) return null` shapes), and generic names (`handleData`, `processItem`, `result`, `temp`, `manager`). Report each tell with a **count** + 1-2 `file:symbol` offenders — the count is what separates a real convention from repeated slop.
- **Ceremony & tool-slop fingerprint (mandatory)** — always run; this is how the grill auto-detects over-built noise so Round 7 can keep/kill with real paths. Use the catalog in [`simplify-code/references/ceremony-smells.md`](../simplify-code/references/ceremony-smells.md) (C1–C8; ships with the `simplify-code` skill). Hunt at least:
  - **Tool wrappers** — scripts/package targets that only `spawn`/`exec` an official CLI (`wrangler`, `biome`, `drizzle-kit`, `tsc`, `vitest`, `next`, …) with no product glue.
  - **House typegen / drift theater** — custom type generation, snapshot re-diff, header canonicalize, UUID workspaces around a tool that already exists.
  - **Wrong tool for the type job** — e.g. wrangler used as if it produced SQL row types; parallel hand schemas for vendor SDKs.
  - **Scripts layout** — anything under `src/scripts/`, app-local `scripts/`, flat root script dumps, or nests other than product `scripts/dev` + `scripts/production`.
  - **Orphan generated** — `*.generated.*` / committed outputs only justified by a dead or unjustified custom generator.
  - **`console.log/error/warn`** density vs a single structured logger + env mute.
  - **Micro-files** (~5–15 lines / one helper / one caller) and **generic locals** after async/Effect/SQL (`result`, `data`, `row`, `outcome`).
  For each hit report: **family (C#)** · **path** · **official tool that replaces it** (or “product glue — keep lean”) · **orphan artifacts to delete with it** · **count** if repeated. Sort a draft **kill list** (easy pure wrappers first). No soft-pedaling high counts — repeated ceremony is still ceremony.

## Each agent reports

- The 3-5 most-repeated patterns it saw, each with 1-2 concrete `file:symbol` examples.
- A short **verbatim snippet** (≈5–12 lines) of the dominant pattern for each dimension, copied exactly with its `file:symbol`. This is the raw material for the **pick-the-code gallery**: variant **A** is this real incumbent, shown in the TUI for the user to react to — so keep it copy-paste faithful, not paraphrased.
- A **count / prevalence** for each repeated pattern (e.g. "arrow fns: 47/52 files"), not just presence — the grill weighs keep-vs-kill on frequency, and it's what tells a real convention apart from repeated slop.
- The dominant convention AND notable deviations (deviations are grill fodder — they're where taste is undecided).
- No recommendations — just what the code actually does.

## Bring back

Merge into one compact "current reality" brief: for each dimension, the dominant pattern + a real *before* candidate. Feed that into the grill — "the code does X here; keep it, or is this the slop to kill?" Do not treat the dominant pattern as correct by default; it's just the starting evidence. Include the **directory tree + import edges** (for §⑤), the **de-facto extension path** (the ordered seams recent units touched, for the Step 6 golden path), the **AI-slop fingerprint tally** (each tell + count + a real offender, to drive the `Never`-list grill), the **ceremony kill list** (C1–C8 hits with replace-with tool + orphans — drives Round 7 keep/kill and the plan's cleanup section), and each dimension's **verbatim incumbent snippet** (variant A of its pick-the-code choice — see [STYLE-CATALOG.md](_shared/STYLE-CATALOG.md)).
