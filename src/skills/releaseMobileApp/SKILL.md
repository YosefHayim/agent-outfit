# Release mobile app

A mobile store release has two identities: the **source you intended** (git SHA, branch, dirty state) and the **binary actually built and uploaded** (version, build number, build ID, store track). Record both, plus what changed, before calling a release shipped.

## Toolchain policy (Launch-first)

| Priority | Tool | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Default** | **[Launch](https://github.com/YosefHayim/launch-store)** (`launch` from npm `launch-store`) | Always prefer when the repo has (or can get) `launch.config.ts` / Launch is installable |
| **Optional fallback** | Expo EAS (`eas build` / `eas submit`) | Only if the user explicitly opts out of Launch, or Launch cannot run and they approve EAS |
| **Last resort** | Project-specific scripts / CI | Only if documented in the repo and Launch/EAS are not the path |

Do **not** default to EAS. Default is **Launch for every build and upload** in this skill.

Map (when explaining to the user):

| Launch | Rough EAS analogue |
|---|---|
| `launch build <platform>` | `eas build` + upload to testing track |
| `launch build … --no-submit` | build only (no upload) |
| `launch release <platform>` | public production submit (deliberate) |
| `launch status` / `launch status --watch` | store processing / review state |
| `launch doctor` | toolchain + account readiness |
| `launch sync` / `launch metadata` | store products + listing as code |
| `launch update` | OTA (EAS Update analogue) |

Package: `launch-store` → binary **`launch`**. Prefer local/devDependency or `npx launch-store` / `pnpm exec launch` / global `launch` — use whatever the project already has; do not invent a second install if one works.

## Safety

- Confirm platforms (iOS / Android / both), track (TestFlight, Play internal/closed/open, production), and authorization before bumping versions, building, or uploading.
- **Testing track is default.** `launch build` uploads to TestFlight / Play internal (or profile default). **Public production** is only via `launch release` (or explicit user-approved production track) — never treat a testing upload as production.
- Never print, commit, or paste Apple/Google API keys, `.p8`, keystore passwords, service-account JSON, provisioning secrets, or production `.env` values.
- Do not force-push, rewrite release tags, or overwrite store listings without explicit ask.
- Prefer repo scripts and `launch.config.ts` over one-off command invention.
- Production / `launch release` always needs an explicit human go-ahead (even with `-y` only after that approval).

## Workflow

### 1. Orient on the app

Read evidence first:

- **Launch (preferred):** `launch.config.ts`, `store.config.json`, `.env.example` (not secrets), `launch doctor` output when useful
- **Expo / app identity:** `app.json` / `app.config.*` — name, slug, version, `ios.buildNumber`, `android.versionCode`, bundle IDs
- **Optional legacy:** `eas.json` (profiles) — still useful for context if migrating; do not prefer it over Launch
- `package.json` scripts related to version / build / ship
- Any `docs/` release notes, `CHANGELOG*`, previous release tags
- Git: branch, `HEAD` SHA, clean/dirty, upstream

State the release target back in one short block before changing anything:

- app name + platforms
- toolchain: **Launch (default)** or approved fallback
- intended profile / track
- current version + iOS build number + Android versionCode
- source SHA (+ dirty warning if uncommitted)

If Launch is missing but the project is Expo/RN store-bound:

1. Offer `launch init` or `launch migrate eas` (when `eas.json` exists) / `launch adopt` (when the app already ships in ASC).
2. Do not silently fall back to EAS — ask once: continue with Launch setup, or **opt into** EAS fallback.

### 2. Decide release intent

| Field | Examples |
|---|---|
| Platforms | iOS, Android, both (and tvOS/macOS/visionOS only if the repo targets them) |
| Track | TestFlight / Play internal (default via `launch build`); production only via `launch release` |
| Version policy | `launch build ios --bump patch\|minor\|major\|keep` (or project policy) |
| Toolchain | **Launch (default)** / EAS (opt-in) / script (opt-in) |
| Notes audience | internal (team), store (public What’s New) |
| Code freeze | committed+pushed SHA preferred; dirty tree → stop and ask |

### 3. Diff: what actually changed

From the last shipped baseline (last release tag, last known store version, or user-given SHA):

- `git log --oneline <baseline>..HEAD`
- high-signal `git diff --stat`
- user-facing bullets only in the write-up

**Release delta:**

- User-facing changes
- Technical notes (short)
- OTA vs native binary notes if relevant (`launch update` vs new binary)

### 4. Version & native identity

Align:

- Marketing version
- iOS build number (must increase per TestFlight/App Store upload)
- Android versionCode (must increase per Play upload)

Prefer Launch’s bump flags / config over hand-editing when Launch owns the pipeline. Record before → after.

### 5. Readiness (Launch default)

```bash
launch doctor
# optional teaching pass:
launch build ios --dry-run
```

Fix blockers (toolchain, creds, config) before a real build. Do not dump secret values from `--print-env` into chat logs.

### 6. Build & upload — Launch (default)

```bash
# Full pipeline: prebuild → sign → size-check → upload to testing track
launch build ios
launch build android
# or both in sequence when both platforms are in scope

# Build only (no upload) when the user wants a binary without store push:
launch build ios --no-submit
launch build android --no-submit

# Common flags (use when intent matches):
#   -p, --profile <name>
#   -a, --app <name>
#   --bump patch|minor|major|keep    # iOS
#   --track internal|closed|open|production   # Android; default internal — production needs clear intent
#   --distribution store|internal
#   --remote aws | --remote user@host   # iOS without local Mac
#   -y   # only after user approved the plan
#   --explain
```

Capture:

- command + flags actually run
- platform + profile + track/distribution
- git SHA at kickoff (`git rev-parse HEAD`) + clean/dirty
- version + build number / versionCode
- artifact type (IPA / AAB / APK) and any Launch build id / local artifact path from `launch builds list` when available
- upload destination (TestFlight vs Play track vs internal distribute)

Do not claim “uploaded” until Launch reports success (or store shows the build). CLI start ≠ processing complete.

### 7. Public production — Launch (explicit only)

```bash
# Deliberate public store path — confirm with user first
launch release ios
launch release android

# Optional: watch review / processing
launch status --watch
```

Never run `launch release` (or Android production track) unless the user clearly authorized **production**.

### 8. Optional fallback: EAS (opt-in only)

Only after explicit user choice or Launch impossible + user approval:

```bash
eas build --platform <ios|android|all> --profile <profile>
eas submit --platform <ios|android> --profile <profile> --latest
```

Still record the same identity fields (SHA, version, build numbers, EAS build IDs). Note in the release record: **toolchain: EAS (Launch bypassed — reason: …)**.

### 9. Prove what is out there

| Identity | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Source | git SHA, branch, clean/dirty, tag |
| Config version | version + build numbers at build time |
| Build | Launch build/artifact id or EAS build id; finished status |
| Store | TestFlight build visible / Play track; `launch status` when using Launch |

If SHA, version, or build number disagree with intent — stop and report the mismatch.

### 10. Write the release record

Durable record only if the project already uses one or the user asks (`CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub Release body, store What’s New).

**Template:**

```markdown
# Mobile release — <app> <version> (<platforms>)

## Identity
- Date: <ISO date>
- Git: <branch> @ <full SHA> (clean|dirty)
- Toolchain: Launch (default) | EAS (opt-in) | other
- Version: <x.y.z>
- iOS buildNumber: <n> → TestFlight/App Store: <yes/no/pending>
- Android versionCode: <n> → Play track: <internal|closed|open|production|n/a>
- Profile: <name>
- Build IDs / artifacts: …
- Commands run: `launch build …` / `launch release …` (or fallback)

## What changed (user-facing)
- …

## What changed (technical)
- …

## Verification
- Build status: …
- Store visibility (`launch status` if applicable): …
- Device smoke: … (pass/fail/not run)

## Notes / follow-ups
- …
```

### 11. Hand off, don’t over-claim

**Done** means identities recorded, authorized Launch (or approved fallback) actions finished or clearly pending, mismatches called out, next human steps listed.

**Not done:** version bump only, build started only, upload without processing success, production assumed from TestFlight/internal.

## Verification checklist (report to user)

- [ ] Source SHA + clean/dirty
- [ ] Toolchain used (Launch default vs approved fallback + reason)
- [ ] Version / iOS buildNumber / Android versionCode (before → after)
- [ ] Platforms + track
- [ ] Build + upload command results
- [ ] Store visibility / `launch status` when relevant
- [ ] User-facing changelog bullets
- [ ] Explicit production authorization (if `launch release` or production track)
- [ ] Open risks or manual console steps

## Anti-overlap

| Request | Prefer |
|---|---|
| Web/API “is it live?” | `deploy-and-check` |
| Local simulator/device UI QA, no store upload | `run-local-and-check` |
| Git commit/push/handoff without store release | `finish-and-push` / `organize-commits` |
| Store binary + TestFlight/Play provenance (Launch-first) | **this skill** |
