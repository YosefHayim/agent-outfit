# Which skill — freeform → skill map

Use this as a quick lookup. Prefer **one primary** skill.

## Delivery & git

| You say… | Primary | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|
| git commit push, wrap up, open PR, report when done | `finish-and-push` | Topic branch by default; no remote delete |
| split commits, conventional messages only | `organize-commits` | Outer loop still finish-and-push if “done” means handoff |
| new branch + small edit + PR | `finish-and-push` | Not clean-repo-by-feature |
| one feature fully to main (tests, act, merge, reinstall) | `ship-one-feature` | `/ship-one-feature` or existing `#N`; reuses run-tasks-in-parallel + finish-and-push |
| test gaps unit/MSW/e2e scan then TDD | `find-missing-tests` | `/find-missing-tests`; headless e2e default |
| over-engineering scan + before/after + TDD prove | `simplify-repo-with-tests` | `/simplify-repo-with-tests`; reuses simplify-code; headless e2e default |
| test gaps parallel lanes merge to main | `ship-missing-tests` | `/ship-missing-tests`; resume report; default merge after gates |
| numbered task list full SDLC one agent each | `run-tasks-in-parallel` **execute** | `/run-tasks-in-parallel` |
| merge many worktrees / salvage lanes | `run-tasks-in-parallel` **land-lanes** | |
| spawn many agents / `.worktrees/` / one issue per lane | `run-tasks-in-parallel` **setup-lanes** | |
| whole messy repo, every feature, backup main | `clean-repo-by-feature` | |

## Quality of code / structure

| You say… | Primary |
|----------|---------|
| deslop, AI slop, kill ceremony, ban payload/result (local/scope) | `simplify-code` |
| identify over-engineering whole repo, prove lean, fewer files/LOC same behavior | `simplify-repo-with-tests` |
| make readable / rename for clarity | `make-code-readable` |
| restructure whole repo / better project structure / rename across the codebase / which deps do we not need | `restructure-repo` |
| CODE-STYLE grill or compliance audit on existing repo | `code-style-existing-project` (grill vs audit mode) |
| brand-new empty project style | `code-style-new-project` |
| teach stack choices | `explain-my-stack` |
| plan / design grill | `question-my-plan` / `question-plan-with-docs` |

## Prove it works

| You say… | Primary |
|----------|---------|
| launch local, playwright, e2e, don’t deploy | `run-local-and-check` |
| scan/fill missing unit mocks e2e per feature (TDD) | `find-missing-tests` |
| over-engineering kill list + TDD parity + headless e2e | `simplify-repo-with-tests` |
| missing tests campaign worktrees PRs merge | `ship-missing-tests` |
| redeploy, is live, production smoke | `deploy-and-check` |
| /fix-bug, reproduce then fix, fix these bugs | `fix-bug` |

## Meta / skills / sessions

| You say… | Primary |
|----------|---------|
| which skill / refine my prompt / too many skills | **`which-skill`** (this) |
| fix this skill from feedback | `improve-skill` |
| scan sessions for repeated work | `find-repeated-prompts` |
| bench skill A vs B | `benchmark-agents` |
| turn what we just did into a skill | `save-as-skill` |
| add a new skill / make a skill that… / new skill from a description | `add-skill` |
| sync skills to all agents | `install-skills` |

## Repo / platform utilities

| You say… | Primary |
|----------|---------|
| kill ports except metro | `free-ports` |
| clone all GH repos into Code | `clone-all-repos` |
| wrangler / D1 / KV ops | `manage-cloudflare` |
| README / AGENTS docs set | `write-readme` |
| Chrome Web Store listing SEO | `chrome-store-seo` |
| mobile store release | `release-mobile-app` |

## Agent artifact paths (anti-slop)

Campaign / audit MD is **not** product SSOT. Skills must write under **`docs/agent/<campaign>/<run-id>/`** (UTC `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%SZ`; create if missing; set `CURRENT` pointer), never:

- the repository root (reports, audits, campaign boards)
- fixed flat paths like `docs/agent/<campaign>/BOARD.md` that parallel agents overwrite
- product **`docs/agents/`** (plural — issue-tracker / triage / domain)

| Campaign | Dir |
|----------|-----|
| run-tasks-in-parallel | `docs/agent/run-tasks-in-parallel/<run-id>/` |
| find-missing-tests | `docs/agent/find-missing-tests/<run-id>/` |
| ship-missing-tests | `docs/agent/ship-missing-tests/<run-id>/` |
| simplify-repo-with-tests | `docs/agent/simplify-repo-with-tests/<run-id>/` |
| restructure-repo | `docs/agent/restructure-repo/<run-id>/` |
| code-style-existing-project | `docs/agent/code-style-existing-project/<run-id>/` |
| clean-repo-by-feature | `docs/agent/clean-repo-by-feature/<run-id>/` |
| improve-ux | `docs/agent/improve-ux/<run-id>/` |
| benchmark-agents | `docs/agent/benchmark-agents/<run-id>/` |
| TEACH (stack grill) | `docs/learning/TEACH.md` |

Root stays for: README, AGENTS, CODE-STYLE, PROJECT, CONTEXT, LANGUAGE.

## Anti-patterns

- Using `clean-repo-by-feature` for a one-line string change  
- Using `deploy-and-check` when they said “run local only”  
- Creating a new skill for a one-off edit  
- Naming five primaries — pick **one** primary, rest supporting  
- Dropping agent report MD on the repository root  


## Template refined prompts

These strings are what should land **in the agent input** (STT inject) or be executed **same-turn** — not a multi-page plan.

**Branch + line edit + PR (no merge):**

```text
finish-and-push: create branch feat/<slug>, apply this exact text change: "<…>",
open PR to main, do not merge, report branch + PR URL + SHA.
```

**One feature all the way to main (tests + act + merge + reinstall):**

```text
/ship-one-feature <feature description>
/ship-one-feature #2
```

**Numbered tasks → one agent each → full SDLC:**

```text
/run-tasks-in-parallel
1. …
2. …
/run-tasks-in-parallel merge
1. …
```

**Scan test gaps (unit + mocks + e2e) then TDD fill; headless e2e default:**

```text
/find-missing-tests
/find-missing-tests scan-only
/find-missing-tests headed
/find-missing-tests surface=web
```

**Identify over-engineering; kill with parity tests; headless e2e default:**

```text
/simplify-repo-with-tests
/simplify-repo-with-tests scan-only
/simplify-repo-with-tests apply
/simplify-repo-with-tests headed
```

**Test gaps all the way: parallel lanes + merge (after gates):**

```text
/ship-missing-tests
/ship-missing-tests resume residual-only
/ship-missing-tests no-merge
/ship-missing-tests max-lanes=6
```

**Messy multi-feature cleanup:**

```text
clean-repo-by-feature: backup main, inventory features, one agent per feature,
issue + branch + PR each, no merge until I review.
```

**Unsure (advice only):**

```text
which-skill: here is my raw ask — <paste> — primary skill + paste-ready refined prompt only.
```

## Seamless UX (how to do this right)

```text
[STT hold-Shift release] or [typed draft]
        │
        ▼
  route-aware refine  (which-skill rules + preserve literals)
        │
        ▼
  insert into focused input  (type_text / caret — user sees it)
        │
        ▼
  user hits Enter  →  normal agent turn in SAME session
        │
        ▼
  primary skill runs (finish-and-push, simplify-code, …)
```

| Approach | Feels like | Use |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Refine → **input** → Enter | Talking to one agent | STT / pre-send (preferred) |
| Messy Enter → **same turn** silent route + execute | One reply, work happens | Typed freeform already sent |
| Separate “routing chat” then restart | Interrupt / context switch | **Avoid** |
| Manual Cmd+C / Cmd+V as the product | Clunky | Only internal to `type_text` |

Existing pieces live in **voxkey**, a separate app: its dictation pastes into the caret, and its prompt refinement can run on the final transcript before typing the refined prompt into the caret (mode A). See the voxkey docs for its settings.
